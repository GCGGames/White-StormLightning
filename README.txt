White - Storm: Lightning is a 2.5D easy to use, fast, powerful game engine written in C++ and Lua. It has a lot of nobs and buttons under the hood that are defaulted but not cut off from modification and addition. It features an addressable entity system or entity ID system where every entity is easily and efficiently identifiable and classified within the engine as well as excitability both through and outside its unique "Hierarchical Component System" which allows well defined "hierarchical components" to come packed with everything a game object then an instance of that object needs, all while being identifiable on that basis. Currently in it's alpha version, WSL (White - Storm: Lightning) is in it's fourth release (r5, starting from 0). The White - Storm: Lightning website is currently under reconstruction. To find out more, please look out the series of video tutorials (2 more should be expected at some point in the future to complete the series): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-U6QtGUhis&list=PL0YxqVtqQP1c-xjymjEtgK5PiHpT7pEKp . A correction on the "Geometry Class" tutorial, the method used should be `ThreadObject` (which does NOT refer to multi threading) not `GetObject` which does not require all the resetting to be done.
